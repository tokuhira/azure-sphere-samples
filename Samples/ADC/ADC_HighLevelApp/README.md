# Sample: ADC (High-level app)

This sample application demonstrates how to to do analog-to-digital conversion on the MT3620 high-level core.

The application samples and displays the output from a simple variable voltage source once per second. It uses the MT3620 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to sample the voltage.

The sample uses the following Azure Sphere libraries and requires [beta APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/app-development/use-beta).

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [adc](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-adc/adc-overview) | Manages ADCs |
| [log](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-log/log-overview) | Displays messages in the Visual Studio Device Output window during debugging |

## Prerequisites

The sample requires the following hardware:

- Azure Sphere device

1. [Seeed MT3620 Development Kit](https://aka.ms/azurespheredevkits) or other hardware that implements the [MT3620 Reference Development Board (RDB)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/hardware/mt3620-reference-board-design) design.

1. [10K ohm Potentiometer](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/bourns-inc/3386P-1-103TLF/3386P-103TLF-ND/1232547?_ga=2.193850989.1306863045.1559007598-536084904.1559007598).

**Note:** By default, this sample targets [MT3620 reference development board (RDB)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/hardware/mt3620-reference-board-design) hardware, such as the MT3620 development kit from Seeed Studio. To build the sample for different Azure Sphere hardware, change the Target Hardware Definition Directory in the project properties. For detailed instructions, see the [README file in the Hardware folder](../../../Hardware/README.md).

## Prepare the sample

1. Ensure that your Azure Sphere device is connected to your PC, and your PC is connected to the internet.
1. Even if you've performed this setup previously, ensure that you have Azure Sphere SDK version 19.10 or above. In an Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt window, run **azsphere show-version** to check. Install [the Azure Sphere SDK Preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk) for Visual Studio or Windows as needed.
1. Enable [application development](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/quickstarts/qs-blink-application#prepare-your-device-for-development-and-debugging), if you have not already done so by entering the following line in the Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt window:

   `azsphere device enable-development`
1. Clone the [Azure Sphere samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples) repo and find the ADC_HighLevelApp sample in the ADC folder.

## Set up the ADC connections

1. Connect MT3620 dev board pin H2.2 (GND) to an outer terminal of the potentiometer.
1. Connect both pin 1 and pin 2 of jumper J1 to the other outer terminal of the potentiometer. This connects the MT3620 2.5 V output to the ADC VREF pin and to the potentiometer.  
1. Connect MT3620 dev board pin H2.11 (GPIO41 / ADC0) to the center terminal of the potentiometer.

## Build and run the sample

### Building and running the sample with Visual Studio

1. Start Visual Studio. From the **File** menu, select **Open > CMake...** and navigate to the folder that contains the sample.
1. Select the file CMakeLists.txt and then click **Open**.
1. Go to the **Build** menu, and select **Build All**. Alternatively, open **Solution Explorer**, right-click the CMakeLists.txt file, and select **Build**. This will build the application and create an imagepackage file. The output location of the Azure Sphere application appears in the Output window.
1. From the **Select Startup Item** menu, on the tool bar, select **GDB Debugger (HLCore)**.
1. Press F5 to start the application with debugging.
1. In the Output window select "Show output from: Device Output". The application samples and displays the voltage divider output once every second.
1. Adjust the potentiometer and observe that the displayed value changes.

### Building and running the sample from the Windows CLI

Visual Studio is not required to build an Azure Sphere application. You can also build Azure Sphere applications from the Windows command line. To learn how, see the quick start topic [Build the Hello World sample application on the Windows command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/qs-blink-cli). It walks you through an example showing how to build, run, and prepare for debugging an Azure Sphere sample application.
