# Sample: GPIO (High-level app)

This application does the following:

- Provides access to one of the LEDs on the MT3620 development board using GPIO
- Uses a button to change the blink rate of the LED

The sample uses the following Azure Sphere libraries.

| Library | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [GPIO](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-gpio/gpio-overview) | Manages button A and LED 1 on the device |
| [log](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/reference/applibs-reference/applibs-log/log-overview) | Displays messages in the Visual Studio Device Output window during debugging |

## Prerequisites

The sample requires the following hardware:

- Azure Sphere device

**Note:** By default, this sample targets [MT3620 reference development board (RDB)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/hardware/mt3620-reference-board-design) hardware, such as the MT3620 development kit from Seeed Studio. To build the sample for different Azure Sphere hardware, change the Target Hardware Definition Directory in the project properties. For detailed instructions, see the [README file in the Hardware folder](../../../Hardware/README.md).

## To prepare the sample

1. Even if you've performed this set up previously, ensure that you have Azure Sphere SDK version 19.10 or above. In an Azure Sphere Developer Command Prompt, run **azsphere show-version** to check. Install [the Azure Sphere SDK Preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/install-sdk) for Visual Studio or Windows as needed.
1. Connect your Azure Sphere device to your PC by USB.
1. Enable [application development](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/quickstarts/qs-blink-application#prepare-your-device-for-development-and-debugging), if you have not already done so:

   `azsphere device enable-development`
1. Clone the [Azure Sphere samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sphere-samples/) repo and find the GPIO_HighLevelApp sample in the GPIO folder.

## To build and run the sample

### Building and running the sample with Visual Studio

1. Start Visual Studio. From the **File** menu, select **Open > CMake...** and navigate to the folder that contains the sample.
1. Select the file CMakeLists.txt and then click **Open**.

1. Go to the **Build** menu, and select **Build All**. Alternatively, open **Solution Explorer**, right-click the CMakeLists.txt file, and select **Build**. This will build the application and create an imagepackage file. The output location of the Azure Sphere application appears in the Output window.

1. From the **Select Startup Item** menu, on the tool bar, select **GDB Debugger (HLCore)**.
1. Press F5 to start the application with debugging. See [Troubleshooting samples](../../troubleshooting.md) if you encounter errors.

### Building and running the sample from the Windows CLI

Visual Studio is not required to build an Azure Sphere application. You can also build Azure Sphere applications from the Windows command line. To learn how, see [Quickstart: Build the Hello World sample application on the Windows command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-sphere/install/qs-blink-cli). It walks you through an example showing how to build, run, and prepare for debugging an Azure Sphere sample application.


## To observe the output

LED1 on the MT3620 begins blinking red. Push button A to cycle the blink interval between three possible values.
